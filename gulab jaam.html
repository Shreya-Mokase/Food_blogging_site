                Take khoya (mawa or evaporated milk) in a bowl. Mash it very well. There should be no lumps. You can
                also grate and then mash the khoya.<br>
                Then add grated paneer, rava (sooji), all purpose flour (maida), baking powder and cardamom powder to
                the mashed khoya. There should be no lumps in both the mawa and paneer.<br>

                As if they are there, then you will find the texture of the gulab jamun not so good. The bits and pieces
                of mava or paneer will give a bite in the mouth, when you have the gulab jamun. They won’t be
                smooth.<br>
                Mix well. Add milk and gather together to form a dough with milk. Don’t knead.<br>
                Just gently mix. If you are unable to form balls or if the mixture appears dry, then add a few teaspoons
                of milk. Cover the dough and keep aside for 30 mins.<br>
                Make small balls from the dough. Cover the balls and keep aside.</p>

                Dissolve sugar in water. Heat the sugar solution till it become sticky. You just need to switch off the
                fire before the syrup reaches a one thread consistency.<br>
                Add rose water and stir. Keep the sugar solution aside. On cooling if the sugar syrup crystallizes, then
                just add 2 to 3 tbsp water and warm the syrup again. It will again return to a liquid state.<br></p>

                Meanwhile, while the sugar syrup is cooking, heat oil till its medium hot. Lower the flame and wait for
                a minute. Then gently place the dough balls in the oil.<br>

                Once they start to have tiny golden spots, keep on rotating them in the oil, so that the jamun are
                evenly browned.<br>
                Remove the fried jamun and then drain them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil.</p>

                Then place the hot fried dough balls in the sugar syrup. Continue frying the rest of the dough balls in
                batches.<br>
                When all the jamuns are placed in the sugar syrup, then keep the whole pan with the sugar syrup and the
                gulab jamun, on a low flame for 1 to 2 minutes till the jamun become soft.<br>
                Heating helps the gulab jamun to absorb the syrup and become soft. The jamun increase a bit in size.
                Don’t overcook as then the jamun can break.<br>
                Use a large pan, so that the jamuns are not overcrowded and you can easily stir them gently while they
                are simmering.<br>
                Serve gulab jamun warm or at room temperature. You can also chill them and serve them cold. Garnish with
                rose petals or almond slivers.<br>
