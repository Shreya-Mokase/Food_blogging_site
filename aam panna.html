                Rinse the mangos under tap water. Gently rub them with your hands to remove any debris or deposits. Set
                aside. Add 1.5 cups of water to the Instant Pot insert. Add the rinsed mangoes to the insert. <br>
                Place the lid on the Instant Pot. Seal and secure. Press the ‘Pressure cook button’ and cook on high
                pressure for 10 minutes. Make sure the venting knob is in the sealing position.<br>
                Allow the pressure to release naturally. Once the pin drops, carefully open the Instant Pot. After the
                mangoes are boiled, they will lose their vibrant, rich green color and may not look pleasing, and that’s
                absolutely fine. <br>
                Remove the mangoes from the boiled water and immersing them in ice-cold water to stop the cooking
                process altogether.<br>
                Once the mangoes are comfortable to touch, peel the outer skin of the mangoes.<br>
                Use a spoon to scoop out the pulp from the boiled mangoes. Scrape off the seed and remove all the
                remaining pulp. Save the pulp.<br>
                Transfer the cooled pulp to a blender. Add jaggery. Blend until smooth. <br>
                Pour in 4.5 cups of water and blend until thoroughly combined. <br>
                Pass the pureed aam ka Panna through a fine-mesh strainer. <br>
                Strain through the strainer, pressing to extract all the mango liquid into the bowl. Discard the mango
                fibers. <br>
                Add fresh mint leaves to a blender. Pour in 1/2 cup of water and blend until smooth. <br>
                Pass the mint puree through a fine-mesh strainer into the previously strained aam ka Panna. Discard the
                leftovers. <br>
                Time to spice up our Aam ka Panna. Add rock salt, black pepper, and roasted cumin seeds to the pureed
                aam ka Panna.<br>
                Mix until thoroughly combined. Seal the container and transfer it to the fridge to chill. <br>
                Add ice to the Aam ka Panna and serve choilledgarnished with mint leaves</p>
