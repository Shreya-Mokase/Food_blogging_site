                    Add milk and condensed milk in a thick bottomed saucepan or kadai. Stir and mix well.<br>

                    The amount of milk to be added depends on the sweetness of the condensed milk. So for one tin of
                    condensed milk, you can add up to 4 to 5 cups of milk or more. Add the amount of milk as per your
                    taste. Taste this mixture and if its too sweet, then add more milk. Also keep in mind the mixture
                    thickens while cooking, so add the milk accordingly.<br>
                    Heat this mixture on a low flame and bring to a gentle boil. Keep on stirring at intervals so that
                    the mixture does not get browned or burnt from bottom.<br>
                    The basundi mixture would begin to thicken.<br>
                    Scrape the milk solids from the sides and the cream collected on the top and add it back to the
                    basundi mixture. Overall cooking takes about 20 to 25 minutes on a low flame.<br>
                    Add nutmeg powder, chopped dry fruits, cardamom powder and saffron.<br>
                    Chopped dry fruits, cardamom powder and saffron.<br>
                    Stir and simmer basundi for a minute.<br>
                    Serve basundi hot, warm or chilled garnished with some saffron strands<br>
