                In a bowl take besan, maida.<br>
                Add salt, turmeric powder, red chili powder, carom seeds and mix well.<br>
                Add hot oil and mix well with a spoon.<br>
                Let the mixture cool down a little.<br>
                Mix the oil well with the flour. The flour should get texture like breadcrumbs.<br>
                Add a little water at a time and knead stiff dough.<br>
                The dough should not be soft or it may have cracks.<br>
                Knead stiff dough and transfer it into a bowl for resting.<br>

        <p class="heading recipeinfo">For Stuffing:</p>
        <div class="description">
            <p>
                Clean the coriander leaves after buying form the market.<br>
                Separate the leaves and wash them well.<br>
                Spread the leaves on a clean napkin and let then dry completely preferably overnight.<br>
                Chop the dried coriander leaves finely and keep them aside.<br>
                Heat up a pan on medium heat.<br>
                Add poppy seeds, sesame seeds, dry grated coconut and fry on medium heat until coconut gets nice golden
                color.<br>
                Transfer the mixture into a blender jar and just give it 2-3 pulses.<br>
                It should have coarse texture and not a fine one.<br>
                You also can pound the mixture into a mortar and pestle.<br>
                In the same pan, heat up oil.<br>
                When the oil is enough hot, turn off the gas.<br>
                Add red chili powder, turmeric powder, kala masala and mix well.<br>
                Add blended masala and mix well.<br>
                Add salt, raisins and mix well.<br>
                Let the mixture and the pan cool down completely.<br>
                When everything is cooled down completely add chopped coriander leaves and mix well.<br>
                The stuffing is already.<br>
                The pan and the masala should be completely cooled down or the coriander leaves will release lot of
                moisture.</p>

        <div class="description">
            <p>
                In a bowl take kala masala.<br>
                Add salt, oil and mix well.<br>
                Kala masala chutney for spreading over the pari is already.<br>
                You can add tamarind chutney if you want.<br>
                Take a small ball of dough and smoothen it out.<br>
                Roll it like poori.<br>
                Do not use dry flour while rolling. You can use a little oil if required but not dry flour at all.<br>
                Spread the kala masala chutney over the poori and fill lot of stuffing at the center.<br>
                You should fill enough stuffing so that the vadi wonâ€™t sound empty.<br>
                Fold from one side and then the other.<br>
                Press it well so that vadi should not open up.<br>
                Fold both the edges and you can give it a little triangular or pyramid shape to the vadi by pinching it
                at the center if you want.<br>
                Heat up oil in a pan.<br>
                Drop vadi in oil and fry on low to medium heat until vadi is nice and crispy from both sides.<br>
                Take the vadi out and pudachi vadi is already.<br>
                You can have it as it is or with tamarind chutney</p>
