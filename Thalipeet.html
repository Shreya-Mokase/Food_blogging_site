            <p> First take all the flours, spice powders, carom seeds, sesame seeds, onions, ginger, green chili,
                coriander leaves and salt in a mixing bowl or pan. <br>
                Add 1 teaspoon oil.<br>
                Mix everything very well.<br>
                Then add water in parts and as required.<br>
                Begin to mix the dough.<br>
                Continue to add water in parts and mix everything to a soft and smooth dough. Dough has to manageable,
                moist and very smooth. Depending on the quality and texture of the flour, you can add less or more
                water.</p>

        <p class="heading recipeinfo">Making Thalipeeth</p>
        <div class="description">
            <p> Then wet a muslin cloth or a cotton kitchen napkin with water. Wrung the extra water and spread the
                muslin on the rolling board. The muslin should be moist. Also heat the tawa.
                Now take a portion of the dough. Roll in your palms and flatten it on the muslin.<br>
                With your fingers gently press and flatten the dough to get a flatbread with ¼ inch thickness. While
                flattening you can sprinkle a few drops of water also on the dough.
                Make hole in the center or make 3 to 4 holes at the sides. This helps in frying the thalipeeth well.<br>

                Spread a bit of oil on the tawa. The tawa has to hot. So you can keep it on medium to high flame.
                Regulate the flame as required.
                Lift the muslin cloth and gently place it with the thalipeeth side touching the tawa.<br>
                Now carefully peel the muslin from the rolled thalipeeth dough.<br>
                Sprinkle some oil in the holes as well as the edges.<br>
                Cover with a lid and let the thalipeeth cook for 2 to 3 minutes or till you the base is golden and
                crisp. You can brown the base more if you want.
                Turn over and continue to cook the second side also till you see some brown or charred spots on
                them.<br>
                Remove and serve thalipeeth hot.<br>
                If not serving hot, then you can stack the thalipeeth in a roti basket or casserole, so that they stay
                warm. Prepare all the thalipeeths this way.<br>
                Serve thalipeeth recipe with white butter or fresh curd or pickle or thecha.</p>
