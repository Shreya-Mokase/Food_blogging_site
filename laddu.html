                sugar, and spices. The gram flour batter is fried to make tiny balls or boondi and mixed with sugar
                syrup, nuts or seeds and later shaped to neat round balls. Motichoor ladoo is a popular sweet from the
                North Indian cuisine and often made during festivals or celebrations.</p>

        <div class="description">
            <p>
                Dissolve sugar, saffron threads and water in a pan and keep it on the stove top.<br>
                Cook the sugar solution till it reaches one thread consistency (check step 3 pic to see photo showing
                one thread consistency) and then switch off the flame. Keep the sugar solution aside.) <br> </p>
        </div>
        <p class="heading recipeinfo"> Making Boondi</p>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Make a smooth flowing batter of the gram flour/besan, crushed saffron and water. The batter should
                neither be thick nor thin. It should be a flowing batter without any lumps. The amount of water to be
                added depends on the quality of the the gram flour. So you can add more or less than what is mentioned
                in the recipe.<br>
                Heat oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. The oil has to be moderately hot. Take a perforated
                ladle/spoon. With your hands position the ladle above the oil. You will need one more large ladle/jhara
                to remove the fried boondis.<br>

                Take a large spoon of the besan batter and pour it on perforated ladle/spoon. Press with the other spoon
                so that the batter falls down from the perforations into the hot oil.<br>
                Fry the boondi (gram flour balls) till they become golden. Don’t over fry or make them crisp. When the
                oil stops sizzling, remove the boondis. About 45 seconds to 1 minute is enough to get the correct
                texture in the boondi.<br>
                This step is important because if boondi becomes crisp then motichur laddu won't be soft and they won't
                be able to absorb the sugar syrup.<br></p>
        </div>
        <p class="heading recipeinfo"> Making Motichoor Ladoo </p>
        <div class="description">
            <p>For collecting the fried boondi use a large slotted spoon/jhara. Drain the oil very well after removing
                the boondi and then add them directly to the sugar syrup. Also note that the sugar syrup should be
                hot.<br>

                If the sugar syrup is not hot, then just heat it. In case, the sugar syrup crystallizes, then reheat
                again mixing 1 to 2 tablespoons water. No need to bother about the tailed or flat boondis as we will be
                pulsing them in the blender later.<br>
                Make all the boondis like this and keep on adding them immediately to the sugar syrup. Stir and mix
                well. The boondis should get softened in the sugar syrup.<br>
                In a blender or mixer add the boondi and the sugar syrup. Add 1 tablespoon of hot water and pulse the
                boondi mixture for a few times to get a smaller shape.<br>
                Don't pulse too much otherwise you won't be able to shape the motichur laddu. The amount of water to be
                added depends on the texture of the boondis.<br>
                If the boondis are a bit crisp, then add 1 or 2 tablespoons more of the hot water. The boondis absorb
                the hot water and remain soft and moist.<br>
                Add the magaz/melon seeds and black cardamom seeds. Mix well.<br>
                Apply some oil or ghee on your palms and shape the motichoor ladoo. The mixture would be warm when
                preparing the laddu. On cooling they become firm.<br>
                You can garnish the motichoor ladoo with melon seeds/magaz or raisins. These motichur ladoo can also be
                refrigerated since they are not made from ghee. If you fry them in ghee then the ghee will solidify on
                refrigeration.</p>
